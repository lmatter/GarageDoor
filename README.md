# GarageDoor
Arduino code to trigger my garage door via REST API

This is just a backup for me, though you are welcome to use it.  It's basically the HelloServer example (for ESP8266) with code added to trigger a GPIO pin (D3) for 500ms, simulating a button push.  This is connected to my garage door  button.  This allows me to open my garage door via my home LAN.
